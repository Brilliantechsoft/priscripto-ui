Task ID: [PRI-46] – Doctor Update Profile Page: Currently working on the degree dropdown button functionality

Hello sir I am confused
In the "Configuration" section there are two tabs: "Specializations" and "Educations." But only the admin can add them right
But when a doctor updates their profile they will add this information themselves So how can the admin add it again
Please explain clearly. I tried making the UI but I don't understand this properly
